In the fist session I made lots of outlines of the dragon each time I made one making it again untill I liked the design then proceed to add scales amd detail like eyes after this I added color using rainbow for the scales on top and a yellow on the bottom 
in the 2nd session, I added the backdrop and color I also added a shadow
